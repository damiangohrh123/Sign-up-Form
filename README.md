# Sign-up-Form
Building a sign-up form


UPDATE:

-Completed this project. Quite an easy project compared to calculator and etch-a-sketch.
-CSS styling and position harder than the validation on javascript.
-Still unsure of the syntax of the REGEX patterns. 
-Have to get used to the position:relative and position:absolute.
-Tried making font-size = vh. Makes the font size scalable with screenview size.
